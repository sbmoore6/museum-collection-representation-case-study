# Cultural Representation in American Museums

## Project Overview

This project analyzes cultural representation patterns across two major U.S. art museum collections using publicly available collection metadata. The goal was to evaluate how well different regions are represented and identify potential imbalances in collection composition. This study investigates collections from the [Metropolitan Museum of Art](metmuseum.org) and the [Art Institute of Chicago](artic.edu). The analysis evaluates representation at both the country and continent level and compares museum representation against real-world population and landmass distribution.
